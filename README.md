The torch package contains data structures for multi-dimensional tensors and mathematical operations over these are defined. 
Additionally, it provides many utilities for efficient serializing of Tensors and arbitrary types, and other useful utilities.

It has a CUDA counterpart, that enables you to run your tensor computations on an NVIDIA GPU with compute capability >= 3.0.
